# Energy Monitoring and Control based On Indoor Positioning System
The system consist of power measuring device and smart phone to do indoor locationing. The user requires to hold a smart phone installed with positioning app. Energy that measured by the device will be sent to the cloud tagged with source of collection (location). Finally the energy usage will be sort out by the server (Intel Edison Board) and indicate the amount of usage by each individual user.

## Positioning demo video
In the video link below shows that the phone was doing positioning and push the location to the cloud while the laptop shows the freeboard.io capturing data from the cloud.
